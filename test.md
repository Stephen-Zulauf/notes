# MARKER Test

## Maths

This is a block equation:
$$
\begin{cases}
x = 42\\
y = \log_{10}(x)
\end{cases}
$$

An this is an inline equation: $x\in A$.

@equation
(x+1)^2=-y

## Listings

The first listing is a simple ```cpp``` code and it should be visualized as code (and with syntax highlight if enabled).

```cpp
int 
main(int argc, 
     char *argv[])
{
  std::cout<<"hello world\n";
  return 0;
}
```

The following code block instead can be visualized as _Mermaid_ chart if the extension is enabled in the preferences.

```mermaid
graph LR
A --> B
B -.->C
```

The last code block instead is a _Charter_ plot and the results is plotted as SVG if the extension is enabled:

@figure
```charter
title: a simple plot
x-axis:
  label: x
y-axis:
  label: y
plot:
  x range: -3 3 60
  y math: exp(-(x^2))
  label: gausian
```
@caption(A simple plot)
